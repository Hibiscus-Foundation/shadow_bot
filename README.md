# Shadow Bot

A simple discord bot for moderation  and fun made for the Hibiscus Foundation's Discord Server

Shadow is a mischievous, yet pampered black beast of Hibiscus. He is a kind, bit of floofy goofy, and a loyal doggo who runs around and motivates us all at the foundation. 

With this in mind, we wanted to create a bot similar to him, who can run around the discord server moderating meets and game nights with large participants at various levels from greeting new people to kicking out unruly ones, and also send funny memes and inspirational quotes occasionally to cheer us all up! 

Hibiscus Foundation for social welfare (HFSW) is a Non-for-profit, Non-partisan organisation working primarily on mental health and also on other areas such as women and child empowerment and universal healthcare.
